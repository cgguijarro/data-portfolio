# DataPortfolio

Welcome to my data science portfolio!

## Projects

- [**Car Prices**](https://github.com/cgguijarro/data-portfolio/blob/main/Car_Prices/Car_Prices.ipynb): A supervised machine learning project on regression to develop a predictive model to accurately predict the sale price based on the car's features.

- [**Credit Card Fraud Detection**](https://github.com/cgguijarro/data-portfolio/blob/main/Credit_Card_Fraud/Credit_Card_Fraud.ipynb): A supervised machine learning project on classification to develop a predictive model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.

- [**Unsupervised Learning on Country Data**](https://github.com/cgguijarro/data-portfolio/blob/main/UL_Country_Data/UL_Country_Data.ipynb): An unsupervised machine learning project to categorize countries using socio-economic and health factors.

- [**Brain Tumor Classification**](https://github.com/cgguijarro/data-portfolio/blob/main/Brain_Tumor_Class/Brain_Tumor_Class.ipynb): A deep learning project to develop a model to automatically detect and classify brain tumors from MRI images.

- [**Weather Forecast**](https://github.com/cgguijarro/data-portfolio/blob/main/Weather_Forecast/Weather_Forecast.ipynb): A timeâ€‘series analysis project to develop a predictive model that forecasts future weather temperature based on historical meteorological data.
