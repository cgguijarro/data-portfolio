# Objective
The primary goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model to automatically detect and classify brain tumors from MRI images.

Manual analysis of MRI images is challenging and error-prone, especially given the complexity of brain tumor variations. By automating this process, the model can:
- Assist radiologists and neurosurgeons by providing a second opinion.
- Reduce diagnosis time, which is critical in managing aggressive brain tumors.
- Improve diagnostic accuracy, thereby aiding in timely treatment planning.
- Offer an invaluable tool in developing countries where expert medical professionals may be limited.

This approach not only enhances the efficiency of the diagnostic process but also has the potential to save lives by supporting early detection and treatment decisions.

# Dataset
The dataset consists of MRI images used for brain tumor detection and classification available in Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri/data).
